# 304MaximumLikelihood

Final project for BIOL 304: Maximum Likelihood Models. Worked with Mark Loria on the analysis, although the code is my own.

Analysis was heavily based on the paper
*   Gomez, Brad T., Thomas G. Hansford and George A. Krause.  2007.  "The Republicans Should Pray
      for Rain: Weather, Turnout, and Voting in U.S. Presidential Elections."  Journal of Politics  69 (August):
      649-663
